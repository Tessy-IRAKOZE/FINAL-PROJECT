# ENVIRONMENT POLLUTION ANALYSIS IN RWANDA
Capstone Project – Big Data Analytics
Student: Irakoze Tessy Mick
Institution: AUCA
Date: July 30, 2025

Project Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze environmental pollution trends in Rwanda using a cleaned dataset and visual analytics tools. The goal is to derive meaningful insights that can support government agencies, environmental organizations, and policymakers in making data-driven decisions.

Problem Statement
Can we analyze and monitor pollution level trends effectively over time using structured environmental data?

Pollution is a growing concern in many urban areas in Rwanda. This project investigates how data analytics can help track pollution variations over the years and months, enabling more responsive and preventive measures.
Project Goals
- Identify seasonal and yearly pollution trends
- Detect high-pollution periods and anomalies
- Guide informed decision-making through visual insights
- Prioritize environmental interventions using data evidence
  
Methodology
- Dataset: A cleaned environmental dataset with variables including year, month, pollution_level, and value.
- Tools Used: Power BI (No DAX required).
- Steps:
  • Data preprocessing and cleanup
  • Aggregation and transformation of pollution metrics
  • Creation of visual dashboards (line charts, donut charts, heatmaps)
  • Application of slicers and filters for interactivity

Key Results
Yearly Pollution Trends
- Visualization: Line chart of pollution levels by year.
- Insight: Medium-level pollution is increasing year-over-year, signaling a long-term degradation.
Seasonal Pollution Patterns
- Visualization: Monthly line chart.
- Insight: Recurring peaks suggest cyclical pollution events—possibly due to weather or industrial activity.
Pollution Level Distribution
- Visualization: Donut chart.
- Insight: Medium pollution dominates (74.42%), highlighting environmental health concerns.
High-Pollution Heatmap
- Visuals: Matrix table and max-value indicators.
- Insight: Specific months and years show high pollution spikes—guiding where and when to enforce interventions.

Innovation
This project incorporates innovative strategies in environmental data science:

- Big Data Integration: Handles large, structured environmental data efficiently, laying the foundation for scaling to real-time streams (e.g., sensors, satellites).
- Contextual Visualizations: Uses Power BI to create easy-to-understand, actionable visuals specific to Rwanda’s geography and pollution patterns.
- Intelligent Slicing: Introduces dynamic slicers and filters, empowering users to explore trends interactively without technical skills.
- Local Relevance: Visual outputs are optimized for use by local policymakers, NGOs, and planners—supporting Rwanda-specific environmental goals.
- Scalability Ready: The system is designed with future enhancements in mind, including machine learning prediction, external weather data, and real-time dashboards.

Recommendations
- Increase pollution monitoring during peak months
- Enforce stricter regulations where Medium-level pollution persists
- Develop public campaigns to address pollution in urban areas
- Expand environmental sensor networks for more granular data

Future Work
- Integrate additional datasets (e.g., weather, population, industrial zones)
- Expand pollution classification into High/Very High levels
- Apply machine learning models to predict and prevent pollution spikes
- Deploy real-time dashboards accessible by government and the public
